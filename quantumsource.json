Unfortunately, there has been no easy way for people to play these games whenever they so desired...that is, until now. GBA4iOS was made for one purpose and one purpose only: to help everyone relive their favorite games from their past. Now, every where you take your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch, you can bring and play your classic games with you, giving you practically endless hours of entertainment!\n\nSo that's great and all, but what features does GBA4iOS actually have? Far too many to list in one App Store description, but here are some of the biggest:\n\n\u2022 Multiplayer (iPhone 5 or newer, iPad 4 or newer). GBA4iOS allows you to link with other players nearby and play with them, allowing you to unlock or experience certain events in games that are unavailable to just one player! Plus, nothing is cooler than playing games with your friends.\n\n\u2022 Save States. Ever get frustrated when a game requires you to save only at certain points? Well be frustrated no longer, GBA4iOS fully supports Save States, allowing you to save anywhere in the game and resume right from that point later. Even better, you can protect certain save states so you never accidentally overwrite them (and as everyone knows losing game data is one of the worst things in the world).\n\n\u2022 Cheat Codes. Sometimes games are just too hard, and you need a little boost to help defeat it. GBA4iOS allows you to input and use GameShark, Action Replay, Code Breaker, and Game Genie codes as you see fit. Don't worry, we won't judge!\n\n\u2022 Fast Forward (iPhone 4s or newer, iPad 2 or newer, iPod Touch 5th Gen). Don't you wish there was a way to speed up long cutscenes in games, or to reduce the time doing boring tasks in the game? Well, now there is! GBA4iOS allows you to \"Fast Forward\" through slow parts of the game, allowing you to get back to the fun even quicker.\n\n\u2022 Customizable Controller Skins. Want to change the look of the controller to something more personal? No worries, you can download a multitude of new controller skins from within the app, or download almost countless more from the web! You'll definitely be able to find a controller skin you like.\n\n\u2022 Dropbox Sync. Have multiple devices, or worried something will happen to your games? Dropbox Sync solves both these issues! When enabled, GBA4iOS will sync your game saves, save states, and cheat codes to Dropbox, keeping any and all your devices up to date with your latest changes. Plus, this means your game data is always backed up in the cloud, so if something happens to your device, your data is safe.\n\n\u2022 MFi Controller Support. Sometimes, touchscreen buttons just aren't good enough for the level of precision needed by some games. Luckily, GBA4iOS supports MFi Controllers, allowing you to connect and use physical controllers with your games! Now you can beat that final boss without a sweat.\n\nAll this and more ensures that GBA4iOS will give you the best portable gaming experience, hands down. So what are you waiting for, download GBA4iOS now and enjoy reliving your favorite classic games immediately!", "iconURL": "https://i.imgur.com/SBrqO9g.png", "tintColor": "78209d", "size": 7924507, "screenshotURLs": ["https://i.imgur.com/L4H0yM3.png", "https://i.imgur.com/UPGYLVr.png", "https://i.imgur.com/sWpUAii.png", "https://i.imgur.com/UwnDXRc.png"]}, {"name": "RetroArch", "bundleIdentifier": "com.libretro.dist.ios.RetroArch", "developerName": "libretro", "subtitle": "Cross-platform, sophisticated frontend for emulation.", "version": "1.9.0", "versionDate": "2020-08-07", "versionDescription": "Many bug fixes and quality of life improvements.

Additionally, dynamic resolution (auto-change resolution when VM window is resized) and more fixed resolutions (matching all the screen resolutions of the latest Mac computers) were added to the driver. This requires you to download the latest SPICE tools ISO from https://mac.getutm.app/support/ and run the installer again (or manually updating your GPU driver from the ISO if you know how).\r\n* In v2.4.0, newly created Q35 and PC machine (x86 and x86_64) defaulted to the `Skylake-Client` CPU model. Subsequently, it was discovered that the change caused performance regressions. v2.4.1 reverted the default CPU model to `Default` but if you created a new Q35/PC VM in v2.4.0, it is recommended that you manually change the CPU in System settings to `Default`.\r\n* Since v1.0.0, UTM used the RTL8139 network card as the default for Q35 VMs (x86 and x86_64) and Virt VMs (ARM64). There is a bug in the device implementation that causes the Windows driver to freeze the system and many users reported Windows Installer freezing as well as random freezes through normal use. In v2.4.0, we changed the default network card for Virt machines to `virtio-net-pci` and in v2.4.1, we changed the default network card for Q35 machines to E1000. However, this change only applies to newly created VMs, and any existing VMs may still suffer from the random freeze issues. It is recommended that you change your network card to `e1000` for Q35 machines and `virtio-net-pci` for Virt machines. Windows 7 and above should have the Intel E1000 network card drivers already installed, but the VirtIO Network card requires drivers in the SPICE tools ISO from https://mac.getutm.app/support/ (if you previously installed this, you should have the drivers already on your system).\r\n* (macOS) Since v2.1.2, UTM provided an option (Cmd+,) to \"Use only performance cores by default\" which defaulted to off. When on, any VM which does not have a manually configured CPU count (> 0) will set the CPU count to the number of performance cores on the system. In v2.4.1, we have made this option on by default which means if you previously have not modified this option, then it will now be on. If you turned the option on, it should not change and if you turned the option on and later off again, it should still be off. The reason for this change was because users may not be aware of this option which can result in degraded performance when left off and we believe the default should reflect the best possible performance. Note that as before, if you manually set a VM's CPU count > 0, then this option does not change anything.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n* (iOS) Integrated AltKit for automatically triggering AltJIT when installed with AltStore (1.5b2+) and AltServer (1.5b8+) (thanks @JoeMatt)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed sandbox issues (cannot select file) on jailbroken devices (thanks @Halo-Michael)\r\n* Improved zh-Hans translation (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Fixed inverted mouse cursor colour in Windows\r\n* New VMs will only use PCores by default (unless manually overridden with Preferences or per-VM config), this also fixes #3180\r\n* Changed default Q35 audio card to intel-hda\r\n* Changed default Q35 network card to E1000 and Virt network card to virtio-net (#3130)\r\n* Removed default CPU for Q35 and PC configurations because the Skylake-Client CPU resulted in performance regression (#3249)\r\n* Fixed downloadVM URL action when the ZIP name collides with the .utm name (thanks @conath)\r\n* Fixed a race condition leading to crash when a VM is shut down suddenly\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://getutm.app/install/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues", "downloadURL": "https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/releases/download/v2.4.1/UTM.ipa", "size": 196870358}, {"name": "iDOS", "bundleIdentifier": "com.litchie.idosgames", "developerName": "litchie", "subtitle": "Play DOS games on iOS.", "version": "2.1", "versionDate": "2020-10-20", "versionDescription": "- Support Mfi game controllers\n- Support external bluetooth keyboard (Text input only).\nYou can use Command-1, Command-2 .. for function keys.", "downloadURL": "https://github.com/litchie/dospad/releases/download/2.1/iDOS.ipa", "localizedDescription": "Play classic DOS games on your iPhone and iPad!\n\niDOS turns your device right into a powerful DOS gaming PC, with modern game control to make your old favorites as playable as possible.\n\nYou can also use iDOS for non-gaming purposes, such as word processing, casual programming.
