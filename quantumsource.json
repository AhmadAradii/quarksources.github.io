Unfortunately, there has been no easy way for people to play these games whenever they so desired...that is, until now. GBA4iOS was made for one purpose and one purpose only: to help everyone relive their favorite games from their past. Now, every where you take your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch, you can bring and play your classic games with you, giving you practically endless hours of entertainment!\n\nSo that's great and all, but what features does GBA4iOS actually have? Far too many to list in one App Store description, but here are some of the biggest:\n\n\u2022 Multiplayer (iPhone 5 or newer, iPad 4 or newer). GBA4iOS allows you to link with other players nearby and play with them, allowing you to unlock or experience certain events in games that are unavailable to just one player! Plus, nothing is cooler than playing games with your friends.\n\n\u2022 Save States. Ever get frustrated when a game requires you to save only at certain points? Well be frustrated no longer, GBA4iOS fully supports Save States, allowing you to save anywhere in the game and resume right from that point later. Even better, you can protect certain save states so you never accidentally overwrite them (and as everyone knows losing game data is one of the worst things in the world).\n\n\u2022 Cheat Codes. Sometimes games are just too hard, and you need a little boost to help defeat it. GBA4iOS allows you to input and use GameShark, Action Replay, Code Breaker, and Game Genie codes as you see fit. Don't worry, we won't judge!\n\n\u2022 Fast Forward (iPhone 4s or newer, iPad 2 or newer, iPod Touch 5th Gen). Don't you wish there was a way to speed up long cutscenes in games, or to reduce the time doing boring tasks in the game? Well, now there is! GBA4iOS allows you to \"Fast Forward\" through slow parts of the game, allowing you to get back to the fun even quicker.\n\n\u2022 Customizable Controller Skins. Want to change the look of the controller to something more personal? No worries, you can download a multitude of new controller skins from within the app, or download almost countless more from the web! You'll definitely be able to find a controller skin you like.\n\n\u2022 Dropbox Sync. Have multiple devices, or worried something will happen to your games? Dropbox Sync solves both these issues! When enabled, GBA4iOS will sync your game saves, save states, and cheat codes to Dropbox, keeping any and all your devices up to date with your latest changes. Plus, this means your game data is always backed up in the cloud, so if something happens to your device, your data is safe.\n\n\u2022 MFi Controller Support. Sometimes, touchscreen buttons just aren't good enough for the level of precision needed by some games. Luckily, GBA4iOS supports MFi Controllers, allowing you to connect and use physical controllers with your games! Now you can beat that final boss without a sweat.\n\nAll this and more ensures that GBA4iOS will give you the best portable gaming experience, hands down.

See notes below for some limitations.\r\n* Wizard redesign (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Various UI tweaks, fixes, and improvements (thanks @j-f1). Note that some settings have moved to different categories\r\n* Overhaul of the UTM backend which should improve application stability\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (iOS) **UTM v3.1.x will be the last update to support iOS 11 and iOS 12.** If you are still running those versions, please make sure you report any issues now so they can be fixed by the final release of v3.1.x. After that, iOS 13+ will be required to run future versions of UTM.\r\n* You can now run .utm files stored anywhere. There are a few caveats: First, all newly created VMs will still be created in the default storage (app sandbox). You can move the VM after creation with the new button on the toolbar or by right clicking (or force touch) on the VM entry and selecting \"Move...\" Second, when VM shortcuts are deleted, the underlying data is unaffected, and shortcuts are automatically deleted when they are no longer valid (for example, the .utm was moved). You can re-import the .utm by either double clicking it from Finder, or using \"File -> Import Virtual Machine...\" Finally, Apple VMs do not support persistent shortcuts, which means the shortcut is *always* deleted after UTM quits. This means you must re-import Apple VMs every time UTM is launched.\r\n* Default machine properties will now always be included *unless* explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. For example, if you are booting an aarch64 virt machine, the property `highmem=off` will be appended unless the user specifies `highmem=on` in QEMU settings. Previously, when you select `virt` in VM settings, the machine properties text box will auto populate with `highmem=off`. If the user deletes it, then the VM will not boot because it requires `highmem=off`. Advanced users can still specify `highmem=on` and it will not be overridden.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.4)\r\n* The changes to behaviour of \u201clegacy input\u201d introduced in v3.1.2 is now disabled by default for all existing (x86_64) virtual machines. For new virtual machines, the default is still to disable PS/2 bus when USB is enabled. However, this can be overridden with a new tweak \u201cForce PS/2 Controller\u201d in the QEMU settings. (#3723)\r\n* The computed size for shortcut VMs is properly calculated and saving shorting VM settings works (#3724)\r\n* \"Error: Use -machine help to list supported machines\" shows up when starting a newly created virtualized VM (#3722)\r\n* Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @js-john)\r\n* (iOS 11-13) Default UEFI boot to off because we do not have any UI to change it\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.3)\r\n* *Hotfix*: An earlier release of v3.1.3 had a bug which prevented newly created VMs from booting, this has now been fixed\r\n* Use QCOW2 format for EFI variables on newly created variables image. This enables suspend state to work on EFI enabled VMs again (unless suspend fails for other unsupported devices). Note: existing VMs should delete the EFI variables drive from VM Settings in order for UTM to recreate it as QCOW2.\r\n* The busy spinner gets suck during startup or shutdown (#3702)\r\n* Boots Windows ARM emulation with QEMU TCG by adding `virtualization=on` machine property (#3703)\r\n* Default machine properties will always be included *unless* explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. (See notes above.)\r\n* Various UI tweaks, fixes, and improvements (thanks @j-f1). Note that some settings have moved to different categories.\r\n* Fixed \"Failed to create new bookmark\" when trying to launch a VM shortcut\r\n* Automatically de-toggle UEFI boot tweak on unsupported targets\r\n* Fixed a situation that caused UTM to crash randomly (#3515)\r\n* (iOS 14) Toolbar had large overlapping icons on compact devices\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.2)\r\n* Fixed leaking of location data in debug.log (#3667)\r\n* Console mode settings for colours are slightly off from the picker values. This has been fixed by using P3 space hex values.\r\n* Retain ordering of VM list when using move, clone, and edit operations\r\n* Show \"unavailable\" VMs when a shortcut is unaccessible due to the VM being deleted or an external drive not being mounted. No longer deletes these shortcuts by default (#3686)\r\n* Support importing multiple .utm at once (#3685)\r\n* Rename \"import\" menu to \"open\" to reflect the new behaviour of creating a shortcut by default. Add the \"open\" option to the first page of the wizard as well so iOS users can access it\r\n* New context menu option \"New from template...\" can be called to duplicate the settings of an existing QEMU VM without the data (#2339)\r\n* Fixed a UI issue where an error message makes the VM stuck in \"busy\" state\r\n* Disable PS/2 keyboard/mouse when \"legacy input\" is off. Renamed \"legacy input\" to USB mode to make more explicit that when it is off, a USB bus is emulated with the input controls there (#3674)\r\n* Moved USB sharing options to Input tab to consolidate USB settings\r\n* (iOS) Fixed launching on < iOS 15 (except with taurine, which is still broken for different reasons)\r\n* (iOS) Fix saving last display origin and scale (#3669)\r\n* Option to use UTC vs localtime (previous default) in a new option (QEMU -> Tweaks). This resolves clock issues on some Linux distros (#3104)\r\n* (iOS) Ability to fine tune cursor speed (in Settings) (#2522)\r\n* (iOS) Various improvements to scaling including fixing pinch to zoom on iOS 15\r\n* (iOS) Fixed a random crash due to iOS 15 dyld changes (#3672)\r\n* (macOS) Ability to turn off auto QCOW2 conversion when importing an image as well as the ability to create a raw disk image (#3637)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.1)\r\n* Automatically delete broken bookmarks for removable drives and shared directories after showing the error once (#3575)\r\n* Refactored backend QEMU VM manager to support Swift concurrency and also fix some rare race issues\r\n* Added picker for console background and text colour (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Added font style (bold/italics) for console font as well as font chooser for macOS (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Fixed crash/freeze when using UTM URL actions (#3642)\r\n* (iOS) Wizard: style was incorrect on iOS 14\r\n* (iOS) Keyboard visibility state is now stored globally instead of per-VM\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where the keyboard always pops up when an alert shows\r\n* (iOS) On iOS 13.4, old cursor functionality is restored when it was broken by the iOS 14 cursor implementation\r\n* (iOS) iOS 15 introduced a kernel race that leads to a panic and sometimes a purple screen and device reboot whenever GL is used. This has been fixed by reducing the possibility of the race (while we wait for Apple to fix it in iOS kernel) (#2743)\r\n* (iOS) Better error message when attempting to launch an unsupported architecture in UTM SE (#3635)\r\n* (macOS) Added descriptions to screen resolutions and notch-hiding resolutions (thanks @pointum)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.0)\r\n* Improved design of wizard on iOS (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @ty-yqs)\r\n* Refactored backend renderer into [CocoaSpice](https://github.com/utmapp/CocoaSpice)\r\n* Updated backend code to use Swift 5.5 concurrency features\r\n* In Apple VM configs, do not discard non-persistent settings (shared directories) when canceling out of settings window\r\n* Add option to run VM as a shortcut (see notes above) (#132, #1205)\r\n* Added icon for Pop! OS to picker (thanks @conath)\r\n* Fixed QEMU custom argument parsing when there is quoted space in middle of the argument (#3579)\r\n* Update the VM screenshot on a timer (#3499)\r\n* Added new global setting to disable saving screenshot to disk\r\n* Improved synchronization of state from the VM window and the main window (play button visible when stopped, busy spinner visible when starting, etc)\r\n* (iOS) Fix crash while installing on older versions of jailbroken iOS (#3543)\r\n* (macOS) Fix an issue where Apple VM aux storage was not created when switching from Linux to macOS boot option\r\n* (macOS) Ability to move a .utm VM to external storage\r\n* (macOS) Toolbar option to delete VM should be disabled when VM is running\r\n* (macOS) Support taking screenshots of Apple VMs\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n* iOS 14 and below: There is a known issue crashing while running under taurine but not unc0ver.

You can move the VM after creation with the new button on the toolbar or by right clicking (or force touch) on the VM entry and selecting \"Move...\" Second, when VM shortcuts are deleted, the underlying data is unaffected, and shortcuts are automatically deleted when they are no longer valid (for example, the .utm was moved). You can re-import the .utm by either double clicking it from Finder, or using \"File -> Import Virtual Machine...\" Finally, Apple VMs do not support persistent shortcuts, which means the shortcut is *always* deleted after UTM quits. This means you must re-import Apple VMs every time UTM is launched.\r\n* Default machine properties will now always be included *unless* explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. For example, if you are booting an aarch64 virt machine, the property `highmem=off` will be appended unless the user specifies `highmem=on` in QEMU settings. Previously, when you select `virt` in VM settings, the machine properties text box will auto populate with `highmem=off`. If the user deletes it, then the VM will not boot because it requires `highmem=off`. Advanced users can still specify `highmem=on` and it will not be overridden.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.4)\r\n* The changes to behaviour of \u201clegacy input\u201d introduced in v3.1.2 is now disabled by default for all existing (x86_64) virtual machines. For new virtual machines, the default is still to disable PS/2 bus when USB is enabled. However, this can be overridden with a new tweak \u201cForce PS/2 Controller\u201d in the QEMU settings. (#3723)\r\n* The computed size for shortcut VMs is properly calculated and saving shorting VM settings works (#3724)\r\n* \"Error: Use -machine help to list supported machines\" shows up when starting a newly created virtualized VM (#3722)\r\n* Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @js-john)\r\n* (iOS 11-13) Default UEFI boot to off because we do not have any UI to change it\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.3)\r\n* *Hotfix*: An earlier release of v3.1.3 had a bug which prevented newly created VMs from booting, this has now been fixed\r\n* Use QCOW2 format for EFI variables on newly created variables image. This enables suspend state to work on EFI enabled VMs again (unless suspend fails for other unsupported devices). Note: existing VMs should delete the EFI variables drive from VM Settings in order for UTM to recreate it as QCOW2.\r\n* The busy spinner gets suck during startup or shutdown (#3702)\r\n* Boots Windows ARM emulation with QEMU TCG by adding `virtualization=on` machine property (#3703)\r\n* Default machine properties will always be included *unless* explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. (See notes above.)\r\n* Various UI tweaks, fixes, and improvements (thanks @j-f1). Note that some settings have moved to different categories.\r\n* Fixed \"Failed to create new bookmark\" when trying to launch a VM shortcut\r\n* Automatically de-toggle UEFI boot tweak on unsupported targets\r\n* Fixed a situation that caused UTM to crash randomly (#3515)\r\n* (iOS 14) Toolbar had large overlapping icons on compact devices\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.2)\r\n* Fixed leaking of location data in debug.log (#3667)\r\n* Console mode settings for colours are slightly off from the picker values. This has been fixed by using P3 space hex values.\r\n* Retain ordering of VM list when using move, clone, and edit operations\r\n* Show \"unavailable\" VMs when a shortcut is unaccessible due to the VM being deleted or an external drive not being mounted. No longer deletes these shortcuts by default (#3686)\r\n* Support importing multiple .utm at once (#3685)\r\n* Rename \"import\" menu to \"open\" to reflect the new behaviour of creating a shortcut by default. Add the \"open\" option to the first page of the wizard as well so iOS users can access it\r\n* New context menu option \"New from template...\" can be called to duplicate the settings of an existing QEMU VM without the data (#2339)\r\n* Fixed a UI issue where an error message makes the VM stuck in \"busy\" state\r\n* Disable PS/2 keyboard/mouse when \"legacy input\" is off. Renamed \"legacy input\" to USB mode to make more explicit that when it is off, a USB bus is emulated with the input controls there (#3674)\r\n* Moved USB sharing options to Input tab to consolidate USB settings\r\n* (iOS) Fixed launching on < iOS 15 (except with taurine, which is still broken for different reasons)\r\n* (iOS) Fix saving last display origin and scale (#3669)\r\n* Option to use UTC vs localtime (previous default) in a new option (QEMU -> Tweaks). This resolves clock issues on some Linux distros (#3104)\r\n* (iOS) Ability to fine tune cursor speed (in Settings) (#2522)\r\n* (iOS) Various improvements to scaling including fixing pinch to zoom on iOS 15\r\n* (iOS) Fixed a random crash due to iOS 15 dyld changes (#3672)\r\n* (macOS) Ability to turn off auto QCOW2 conversion when importing an image as well as the ability to create a raw disk image (#3637)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.1)\r\n* Automatically delete broken bookmarks for removable drives and shared directories after showing the error once (#3575)\r\n* Refactored backend QEMU VM manager to support Swift concurrency and also fix some rare race issues\r\n* Added picker for console background and text colour (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Added font style (bold/italics) for console font as well as font chooser for macOS (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Fixed crash/freeze when using UTM URL actions (#3642)\r\n* (iOS) Wizard: style was incorrect on iOS 14\r\n* (iOS) Keyboard visibility state is now stored globally instead of per-VM\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where the keyboard always pops up when an alert shows\r\n* (iOS) On iOS 13.4, old cursor functionality is restored when it was broken by the iOS 14 cursor implementation\r\n* (iOS) iOS 15 introduced a kernel race that leads to a panic and sometimes a purple screen and device reboot whenever GL is used. This has been fixed by reducing the possibility of the race (while we wait for Apple to fix it in iOS kernel) (#2743)\r\n* (iOS) Better error message when attempting to launch an unsupported architecture in UTM SE (#3635)\r\n* (macOS) Added descriptions to screen resolutions and notch-hiding resolutions (thanks @pointum)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.0)\r\n* Improved design of wizard on iOS (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @ty-yqs)\r\n* Refactored backend renderer into [CocoaSpice](https://github.com/utmapp/CocoaSpice)\r\n* Updated backend code to use Swift 5.5 concurrency features\r\n* In Apple VM configs, do not discard non-persistent settings (shared directories) when canceling out of settings window\r\n* Add option to run VM as a shortcut (see notes above) (#132, #1205)\r\n* Added icon for Pop! OS to picker (thanks @conath)\r\n* Fixed QEMU custom argument parsing when there is quoted space in middle of the argument (#3579)\r\n* Update the VM screenshot on a timer (#3499)\r\n* Added new global setting to disable saving screenshot to disk\r\n* Improved synchronization of state from the VM window and the main window (play button visible when stopped, busy spinner visible when starting, etc)\r\n* (iOS) Fix crash while installing on older versions of jailbroken iOS (#3543)\r\n* (macOS) Fix an issue where Apple VM aux storage was not created when switching from Linux to macOS boot option\r\n* (macOS) Ability to move a .utm VM to external storage\r\n* (macOS) Toolbar option to delete VM should be disabled when VM is running\r\n* (macOS) Support taking screenshots of Apple VMs\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n* iOS 14 and below: There is a known issue crashing while running under taurine but not unc0ver.
